# Rust on Lambda

This is a small repo containing two minimal examples, showing the same functionality implemented in both Typescript and Rust.

It can be used as a starting point for understanding the differences and similarities between these two languages when developing a small handler function targeting AWS Lambda.

These small examples where made to go along with the short presentation titled [Rust on Lambda](./Presentation.md).

## Disclaimer

At the moment the Rust example won't work when deploying it to AWS, the code works fine, but something in the deploy is missing. :(

I will try to return to it shortly (depending on time) to fix these problems.
