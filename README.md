# Lambda repo

This is a small repo containing two minimal examples, showing the same functionality implemented in both Typescript and Rust.

It can be used as a starting point for understand the similarities between these two languages when developing a small handler function targeting AWS Lambda.

These were made as small examples to show along with the short presentation titled Rust on Lambda.
